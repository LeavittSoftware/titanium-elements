**[Conventional Commits ](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/#summary) Required**

The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. This convention dovetails with  [SemVer](http://semver.org/), by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

**[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) Required**

Types enable JavaScript developers to use highly-productive development tools and practices like static checking and code refactoring when developing JavaScript applications.
